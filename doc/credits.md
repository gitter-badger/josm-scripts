## [Easy autoresidential] - 2017-03-28, [SVĚT-HUB]
Credits: [@Piskvor]

We discussed `easy_buildings` that was not usable for @Piskvor because it
does not fit to his workflow. However, he proposed some script that would
make residential area around buildings on the screen. Not exactly what he
wanted (buildings have to be selected before script run) but better than
nothing.

## [Easy buildings] - autumn 2016
Credits: It's me.

This was the first attempt to deal with my laziness. More than a few
clicks and one shortcut keypress is no way. BuildingsTools make the job
for square buildings but not for circle (and I do not copy + resize them
because for me it's too heavy too) nor for residential areas.
