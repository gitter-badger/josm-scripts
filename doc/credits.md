## [Click buildings] - 2017-07-25, [MSF Prague office]
Credits: [@janbohm] and others in pub after Jul 2017 #Prague #Mapathon

After `easy_buildings`, `easy_autoresidential` demonstration and few beers
(overall sum) discussion went to mapping (more exactly cartographying) of
buildings by only making one node. First thought was it's too much for me.

Some credits also to [@Piskvor] who proposed auto building rotation before
`easy_autoresidential` script.

Frustrated by not working Hough Transform for orthogonal building shape. I have
written over 500 lines of code. Deleted twice as much. And still have terrible
results. In that time of despair my dad came with the idea that evolved to
implemented algorithm.

## [Pick residential] - 2017-03-28, [SVĚT-HUB]
Credits: [@Piskvor]

We discussed `easy_buildings` that was not usable for @Piskvor because it
does not fit to his workflow. However, he proposed some script that would
make residential area around buildings on the screen. Not exactly what he
wanted (buildings have to be selected before script run) but better than
nothing.

## [Easy buildings] - autumn 2016
Credits: It's me.

This was the first attempt to deal with my laziness. More than a few
clicks and one shortcut keypress is no way. BuildingsTools make the job
for square buildings but not for circle (and I do not copy + resize them
because for me it's too heavy too) nor for residential areas.
