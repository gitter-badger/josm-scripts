## [Easy buildings] - autumn 2016
Credits: It's me.

This was the first attempt to deal with my laziness. More than a few
clicks and one shortcut keypress is no way. BuildingsTools make the job
for square buildings but not for circle (and I do not copy + resize them
because for me it's too heavy too) nor for residential areas.
